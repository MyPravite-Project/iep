= Infrastructure Enhancement Proposals


This repository is for tracking enhancement proposals to the
link:https://jenkins.io[Jenkins project's]
infrastructure. The goal of this repository is to collect and codify proposals
in a transparent and historically reviewable fashion. It can be thought of
similar to efforts such as the
link:http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html[IETF's RFC process]
or the Python project's
link:https://www.python.org/dev/peps/[PEPs].


= Creating a proposal


. Prepare an AsciiDoc file outlining your proposal, using requirement verbiage following
  link:http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2119.html[RFC 2119]
. Place that document in a folder, numbered sequentially from the previous IEP.
. Open a pull request.
